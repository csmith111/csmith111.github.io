summary:  In this post we will look how Elm enables us to build functional reactive programs.

Reactive programs require us to write programs that respond to a stream of "events". Additionally, making these programs composable allows us to use all our functional programming techniques to manipulate makes these programs - **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**.

The first concept that is needs is how do we represent a stream of events? Just like `List a` represent an extensible structure containing elements of type a, we introduce `Signal a` which contains an extensible structure which contains the type a.

**In some sense there is a relationship/duality between extensible structures (Lists) in space (memory) and Streams of events (Signals) that are extensible structures in time.**

**A Signal is a special type that represents a set of values changing over time** `type Signal a`.The coordinates representing the location of the mouse (Mouse.position) and the keys pressed on the keyboard are examples of Signals.

Our Reactive programs contain "networks" of such signals that we process using some special functions that can process Signals.
Here are the main functions (defined in the [Signal Module][SignalModule]):

* Map
   - `map : (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b`
* Merge
  - `merge : Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a`
* Manage state:
  - `foldp : (a -> s -> s) -> s -> Signal a -> Signal s`
* Filter
  - `filter : (a -> Bool) -> a -> Signal a -> Signal a`

Understanding how to use all these functions and getting familiar with some standard Signals like the mouse position (`Mouse.position : Signal (Int, Int)`)  and keyboard presses (`Keyboard.presses : Signal KeyCode`) should take us a long way towards a clear understanding of **FRP**.

If you have not already done this please take a look at this [great article explaining Signals on elm-lang][Signals-elm-lang].

### Mouse Signals

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)
import Mouse

main : Signal Element
main =
  Signal.map show Mouse.position

{% endhighlight %}

Try this out by pasting this code in the [online editor/runner.][try-elm]

Let us see if we can understand this code. Mouse.position is a Signal that contains a tuple of Integers which are the mouse coordinates, we want to `show` each of these tuples.
Just like we can use the function map for lists:
`map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b`, the Signal module defines a map function that maps a function over a Signal: `map : (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b`.

 So that is all we need to do map show over the Mouse position Signal using Signal.map! (Amazing how close the code in the program is to this description in the text.)

Now let us look at how to write a simple function that operates on two values  and map it over two Signals.

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Mouse
import Signal exposing (map2)
import Graphics.Element exposing (Element, show)

combine x y = show (x, y)

main : Signal Element
main =
  map2 combine Mouse.x Mouse.y

{% endhighlight %}

This should give you a clear picture of how we can take normal functions like `combine` that we can define and **lift/map** them over Signals.

### Keyboard Signals
Now let us look at some programs that manipulate Keyboard events.

Here we will display the Signals generated form the 4 arrow keys.
{% highlight Haskell %}
import Keyboard
import Signal
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)

main = Signal.map show Keyboard.arrows
{% endhighlight %}

Another simple program that manages the keyboard signals from the standards keys.
{% highlight Haskell %}
import Keyboard
import Signal
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)
import Char exposing (..)
import String exposing (..)


main = Signal.map show (Signal.map fromCode Keyboard.presses)

{% endhighlight %}

Easy enough, and I think that we can see a pattern emerging of how we write programs to process Signals.

### Managing state

Okay so now we are familiar with managing Signals, but so far we have just dealt with events as they arise. So we did not have to manage state.
So if for example we want to create a program to count the mouse clicks that have happened so far, then we need to keep a running count of the clicks that have happened it and then increment it every time a new click happens.
To functional programers there is a similar problem with lists.
How do you sum the elements for a list. You have to take an initial value and then increment it. This is done using a fold.
You can see an example of this in the post on [Elm basics][Elm Basics].
So there is a a function similar to fold that works for signals called **foldp**
Looking at the signature:

`foldp : (a -> s -> s) -> s -> Signal a -> Signal s`

we see that `foldp` takes a function and a generic initial state type and threads this state types through the signal, keeping and accumulating state.

{% highlight Haskell %}
module MouseSignals1 where
import Mouse
import Signal exposing (map, foldp)
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)

main = map show (foldp (\_ n -> n+1) 0 (Mouse.clicks))
{% endhighlight %}

Like most good functional programs this one is mesmerizing in its conciseness and simplicity!

### Exercises

* Try and make a counter that counts the number of seconds since the program is launched. Hint: you can use the function `fps : number -> Signal Time` which is one of the tickers defined in the module Time. [See the documentation here.][Time Docs].

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Signal exposing (..)
import Time exposing (..)
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)

main = map show counter

increment = Time.fps 1
counter = Signal.foldp (\_ n -> n + 1) 0 increment

{% endhighlight %}


* Write a program that counts the number of key presses.

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Keyboard
import Signal
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)

main = Signal.map show (Signal.foldp (\_ n -> n + 1) 0 Keyboard.presses)
{% endhighlight %}

* Write a program that builds up a string of all the keys that are pressed.

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Keyboard
import Signal
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)
import Char exposing (..)
import String exposing (..)

main = Signal.map show (Signal.foldp (\keyStr s -> s++ (fromChar  keyStr)) "" (Signal.map fromCode Keyboard.presses))

{% endhighlight %}

* Write a simple clock program that displays the current time.
The code below is not very pretty,  add a background and style the display to make a pretty clock.

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Signal exposing (map)
import Graphics.Element exposing (show)
import Time
import Date exposing (year, hour, minute, second, fromTime)

main =

  Signal.map currentTime (Time.every Time.second)

--construct the time from the time in milliseconds since epoch
currentTime t =
  let date' = fromTime t
      hour' = toString (Date.hour date')
      minute' = toString (Date.minute date')
      second' = toString (Date.second date')
      year' = toString (year date')
      now = "The current time is: " ++ hour' ++ ":" ++ minute' ++ ":" ++ second'
  in
      show now
{% endhighlight %}

* Can you construct a program that takes the mouse position,runs it through two different functions offSetPosition and relativePosition and then displays both results.

{% highlight Haskell %}
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)
import Mouse
import Signal exposing (map, map2)

combine : a -> b -> Element
combine a b = (flow right) [show a, show b]

relMousePosition mp = (toFloat(fst mp)/2, toFloat(snd mp)/2)
offsetMousePosition  mp = (fst mp +100, snd mp +100)

main = map2 combine (map relMousePosition Mouse.position) (map offsetMousePosition Mouse.position)
{% endhighlight %}
